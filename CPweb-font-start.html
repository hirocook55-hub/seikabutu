    <p>THE STORY OF MIMI-NASHI-HOICHI</p>
     <p>More than seven hundred years ago, at Dan-no-ura, in the Straits of Shimonoseki, was fought the last 
       battle of the long contest between the Heiké, or Taira clan, and the Genji, or Minamoto clan.</p>
        <h2>There the Heiké perished utterly, </h2><p>with their women and children, and their infant emperor likewise—now 
        remembered as Antoku Tenno. And that sea and shore have been haunted for seven hundred years... </p>
       <p> Elsewhere I told you about the strange crabs found there, called Heiké crabs, which have human faces on
         their backs, and are said to be the spirits of the Heiké warriors [1]. But there are many strange 
         things to be seen and heard along that coast.</p><h2> On dark nights thousands of ghostly fires hover about 
         the beach,</h2> <p>or flit above the waves,—pale lights which the fishermen call Oni-bi, or demon-fires; and,
       whenever the winds are up, a sound of great shouting comes from that sea, like a clamor of battle.</p>
